<p><strong>Two storms this week:</strong> A quick-moving storm could
bring up to an inch of moisture to the Forest Ranch area late Thursday
night into early Friday morning. The second storm arrives later Friday
afternoon and looks to be much wetter: 2.5 inches of moisture could fall
between late Friday afternoon and Sunday morning.</p>
</div>
<div id="dec.-12-18" class="section level1">
<h1>Dec. 12-18</h1>
<p><strong>Recap</strong>: The wettest storm of the 2022-23 winter so
far is leaving the region today. Anywhere from 2-4” of moisture fell
between Thursday and Sunday night, depending on elevation and
topographic position. The Forest Ranch area picked up around 2.5”. Most
Sierra weather stations have received many times the
snow-water-equivalent for this point in the water year so far.</p>
<p><strong>Near-term</strong>: Most of northern California will see
lower than average temperatures this week. Daytime highs in the mid-40s
and lows near freezing for the foothills of Butte county. After the
system moves out today (Monday), we are looking dry through at least
Thursday. There are chances for another round of light precipitation
over the weekend, but those chances have trended downwards over the last
few days.</p>
<p><strong>Long-term</strong>: Per a few sources (<a
href="weatherwest.com">Danial Swain</a>, but also <a
href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/">NWS Climate Prediction
Center</a>), our future is more likely to be drier-than-average than
wetter-than-average.</p>
</div>
<div id="dec.-19-25" class="section level1">
<h1>Dec. 19-25</h1>
<p>We’ve remained dry since the last round of storms moved out of the
region on Monday (12/12) morning. Recapping the water year so far in
terms of snowpack, all three regions of the Sierra are doing pretty
good…</p>

</div>
<p>In terms of precipitation (not just snowpack), the story for Butte
county is different for the valley vs. the foothills and mountains. The
flat lands look to be just below average over the last 30 days, while
the uplands are riding just above average.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p><strong>This Week</strong>: Generally, cloudy skies with valley fog,
high Rh’s (60-70), and light winds are the story this week. We see some
chances for precipitation on Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning for
the foothills, but accumulations don’t look to be higher than two tenths
of moisture. A smaller cell of moisture passes through on Thursday night
into Friday, but we likely won’t see any rain or snow in Butte county.
We might see some slightly elevated winds out of the north ahead of this
cell early Wednesday morning. Strong inversion forecasted for this
weekend, meaning valley fog and above-average temperatures in the
foothills/mountains.</p>
<p><strong>Next Week</strong>: There are signs pointing towards the
potential for wetter conditions returning by the middle of next week.
The mixed signals are classic: some models show meaningful precipitation
impacting the Sierras, while others show the storm track staying just to
our north.</p>

<h1>January 23-29</h1>
<p>December and January have brought abundant precipitation to
California. In this feast-or-famine region, many are actually thankful
for the reprieve of the last few days. Without diving into the effects
that this wet period has had on our soils, vegetation, and reservoirs
(there are better resources out there, such as <a
href="weatherwest.com">Daniel Swain</a> or <a
href="https://twitter.com/wildland_zko">Zeke’s twitter</a>), I’ll direct

<p><strong>This Week:</strong> We’ll keep the dry and windy period going
through this week before some <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RQIV8WM2LY&amp;ab_channel=ABC10">inside-sliders</a>
bring the potential for light precip over the weekend. The precipitation
picture for the weekend is still unclear, but overall amounts on the
high-end of the forecast range are still relatively low (&lt;0.5”). This
week, we’ll see north winds with period of higher gusts on Wednesday
afternoon into early Thursday morning.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond:</strong> There is the potential for additional
precipitation during the first week of February. If they materialize,
these storms would be mild compared to what we’ve seen over the last
month and a half. Right now, we do not see an imminent return to a
prolonged wet pattern. Beyond, the NWS Climate Prediction Center is
calling for above-normal precipitation during the 10-day, 14-day, and
3-4 week outlooks. However, these are outlooks and not forecasts, which
is to say that they should be treated as speculative. The potential for
a drier pattern to remain in place is there and touted by some as the
more likely scenario. Brian Allegretto, in his daily snow forecast
discussion for the Tahoe area this morning, provided this insight for
February: “That doesn’t mean no storms. We can see the pattern shift at
times to allow in a storm, but overall from what I’m seeing currently it
looks like the rest of the month could see below-average precipitation
in total. We’ll have to see how the first week of the month turns out.
Hopefully, I’m wrong.”</p>
</div>
<div id="february-6-12" class="section level1">
<h1>February 6-12</h1>
<p><strong>Daniel Swain</strong> recaps the <a
href="weatherwest.com">December-January storm cycle</a> in
California.</p>
<p>We can expect north winds today through tomorrow morning with a air
moving from areas of high pressure in the north/east towards the low
pressure in the south/west. The stronger winds may be isolated to
channeled terrain like the Feather River canyon. We’ll see calmer winds
reverting back to the regular SW flow during the day Tuesday/Tuesday
night before again flipping to back to a north-wind pattern for
Wednesday. These flip-floppy winds, while not too strong overall, should
keep skies clear and prevent inversions from establishing in our
area.</p>
<p>Our next chance for precipitation arrives on Friday. Between Friday
morning and midday Saturday, the middle elevations of Butte county could
see as much as 0.3” on the high end. However, it’s possible that only NW
CA will see any meaningful precipitation as the system stays farther to
our north.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond</strong>, our our next storm sets up around 2/14.</p>
</div>
<div id="february-13-19" class="section level1">
<h1>February 13-19</h1>
<ul>
<li>An inside-slider system will bring north winds to the area today
lasting through Wednesday. The strongest winds will for the Butte county
foothills will be midday today through early Wednesday morning (15-20mph
with gusts 25-35).<br />
</li>
<li>Chances for precip starting Thursday evening into Friday morning,
but the potential for anything more than 0.2” is low. Like the system
that was forecast for last Friday/Saturday, it may end up providing
wetting precip to the higher elevations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The weekend: we remain in a N-wind pattern, but current forecast
shows no gusts. Sustained speeds around 10 now.</p>
<p>It appears that the table might be set for a troughing pattern to
establish later next week (around the 22nd/23rd). This is only to say
that the storm door will be open, but not necessarily active. The
takeaway: we do not plan on seeing another single or parade of ARs any
time soon.</p>
</div>
<div id="february-27" class="section level1">
<h1>February 27</h1>
<p>Let’s just say I was probably a little over-eager in suggesting that
ARs will not impact CA in the near-term…. Snow fell down to ~1,000ft
across much of CA during the last few days, and more is on the way over
the next 48 hours. The <a
href="https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?CityName=Forest+Ranch&amp;state=CA&amp;site=STO&amp;textField1=39.8822&amp;textField2=-121.672&amp;e=0#.Y_zyaHbMLcB">NWS
point forecast for BCCER</a> shows the potential for over a foot of snow
by end of day tomorrow! Snow levels will fluctuate around 1000ft during
the main period of precipitation expected to last into tomorrow evening.
Freezing levels could drop below 1000ft late tomorrow night. The Center
for Western Weather and Water Extremes maintains an excellent <a
href="https://cw3e.ucsd.edu/DSMaps/DS_freezing.html">dashboard</a>
showing watershed-level precipitation forecasts by precipitation
type.</p>
<p><strong>What’s ahead:</strong> After a break on Thursday/Friday, the
chances for more precipitation remain high into the first full week of
March. Colder than average temperatures should remain in place across
the northern half of CA through mid-March. the precipitation outlook
into the second week of March is foggy. Brian Allegretto described the
uncertainty in his blog post this morning: “We could see a brief break
by the 9th, but by the 10th=11th through mid-month, the long-range
models are still trending toward a shift in the pattern from a cold/wet
pattern to a warmer/wet pattern….But with the convection near the
equator moving through the eastern Pacific from the active phase of the
MJO circulation, it can strengthen the circulations northward and
strengthen and help to extend the jet stream towards the West Coast
coming inland on the north side of the ridge and south side of the
troughs to the north, which only helps to amplify the jet and
storms….The long-range models are continuing to show wetter storms
moving west to east across the Pacific into CA by the 10th and beyond.
These would likely be warmer storms with fluctuating snow levels and
rain at times on top of the deep snowpack, and possibly a couple of
stronger AR (atmospheric river) events. They show above average precip
continuing for the 8th-14th, and you can see the source to the
west.”</p>
